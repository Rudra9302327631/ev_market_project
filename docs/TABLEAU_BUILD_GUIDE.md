# Tableau Build Guide — EV Market Performance & Insights

## 1. Connect and validate

Recommended analysis table: `ev_market` in `data/ev_market.db`. It contains the 37 original CSV fields plus `source_split` and generated `record_id` (39 fields total), with 199,999 cleaned training rows after removing one exact duplicate `vehicle_id`. The 100,000-row test split is stored separately in `ev_market_test` and excluded from dashboard aggregates. If your Tableau installation has no SQLite connector, export `ev_market` to a CSV using Python:

```python
import sqlite3, pandas as pd
with sqlite3.connect('data/ev_market.db') as con:
    pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM ev_market', con).to_csv('outputs/ev_market_clean.csv', index=False)
```

In Tableau, verify row count = 199,999 and field count = 39. Set geographic role of `manufacturing_country` to Country/Region. Check `model_year` is a whole number and all numeric measures have numeric data types.

## 2. Nine unique visualizations

### Fix the Price vs Range scatter plot (record-level marks)

Connect Tableau to the full `ev_market` table, not `price_range_by_category.csv`. The aggregate CSV contains one row per category and can only produce a handful of category-level points. In the Data pane, locate the original `vehicle_id` field (dimension) and drag it to **Detail** on the Marks card. If Tableau only offers `vehicle_id (Count (Distinct))`, right-click that generated field and choose **Remove**; then find the underlying `vehicle_id` under Dimensions or use **Data → Refresh All Extracts** after confirming the selected table is `ev_market`. Do not place the count-distinct measure on Detail.

Set Columns to `AVG(price_usd)`, Rows to `AVG(range_km)`, Color to `category`, and `vehicle_id` to **Detail**. To make one dot represent each vehicle record without relying on Detail, use `price_usd` and `range_km` as disaggregated row-level measures (Analysis → uncheck Aggregate Measures), then verify the status bar mark count is close to 199,999 before filters. Keep tooltips for `vehicle_id`, `model_name`, `manufacturer`, price, and range. If the workbook uses an extract, refresh it from the same `ev_market` table. These steps address the five overlapping category-average marks described in the earlier Tableau issue.

The local Flask preview also uses one database row per mark for its Price vs Range chart. The other preview charts remain grouped summaries for readability.

Create each as a separate worksheet; use meaningful titles and informative tooltips.

| # | Worksheet title | Chart | Fields / setup |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | EV Market Performance at a Glance | KPI cards | COUNTD(vehicle_id), COUNTD(manufacturer), SUM(annual_sales_units), AVG(customer_rating), AVG(range_km), AVG(battery_capacity_kwh) |
| 2 | EV Category Performance & Distribution | Horizontal bar | Rows: `category`; Columns: SUM(`annual_sales_units`); sort descending; label top categories |
| 3 | Market Share by Manufacturer | Horizontal bar / lollipop | Rows: `manufacturer`; Columns: SUM(`annual_sales_units`); sort descending; Top 10 or Top 15 filter |
| 4 | Customer Rating Records by EV Category | Treemap | `category` on Label; COUNT(`vehicle_id`) on Size; AVG(`customer_rating`) on Color/Tooltip |
| 5 | Annual EV Sales Trend by Model Year | Line | Columns: `model_year`; Rows: SUM(`annual_sales_units`); show markers and labels where readable |
| 6 | Battery Technology Market Share | Donut or pie | `battery_type` on Color; COUNT(`vehicle_id`) on Angle/Label; include share percentage |
| 7 | Electric Vehicle Distribution by Manufacturing Country | Filled map | Geographic `manufacturing_country`; Color by COUNT(`vehicle_id`); tooltip sales, rating, range |
| 8 | Battery Capacity vs Driving Range | Scatter plot | X: AVG(`battery_capacity_kwh`); Y: AVG(`range_km`); Color: `battery_type`; Detail: `category`; Size: AVG(`annual_sales_units`) |
| 9 | Price vs Range by Category | Scatter plot | X: AVG(`price_usd`); Y: AVG(`range_km`); Color: `category`; Detail: `vehicle_id` (one mark per record); include `manufacturer` and `model_name` in tooltip; use log price axis only if it improves readability |

Do not use an aggregate CSV as the sole data source for the final dashboard if you need all row-level filter combinations. Use the cleaned `ev_market` table for the workbook; aggregates are for checking results and lightweight previews.

## 3. Calculated fields (create at least 6; recommended 8)

1. **Sales Market Share**
   ```tableau
   SUM([annual_sales_units]) / TOTAL(SUM([annual_sales_units]))
   ```
   Format as percentage. Table calculation direction must be checked for each view.

2. **Range per kWh**
   ```tableau
   IF AVG([battery_capacity_kwh]) > 0 THEN AVG([range_km]) / AVG([battery_capacity_kwh]) END
   ```

3. **Price per km of Range**
   ```tableau
   IF AVG([range_km]) > 0 THEN AVG([price_usd]) / AVG([range_km]) END
   ```

4. **Rating Band**
   ```tableau
   IF [customer_rating] >= 4.5 THEN "Excellent"
   ELSEIF [customer_rating] >= 4.0 THEN "High"
   ELSEIF [customer_rating] >= 3.0 THEN "Moderate"
   ELSE "Low"
   END
   ```

5. **Range Band**
   ```tableau
   IF [range_km] >= 500 THEN "500+ km"
   ELSEIF [range_km] >= 350 THEN "350–499 km"
   ELSEIF [range_km] >= 200 THEN "200–349 km"
   ELSE "Under 200 km"
   END
   ```

6. **Model Age (Years)**
   ```tableau
   YEAR(TODAY()) - [model_year]
   ```
   Interpret as age relative to the current date, not product lifecycle truth.

7. **CO2 Saved per 1,000 Sales**
   ```tableau
   IF SUM([annual_sales_units]) > 0 THEN
     SUM([co2_saved_tons_per_year]) / SUM([annual_sales_units]) * 1000
   END
   ```
   Confirm that the source metric definition supports summing CO₂ saved across models before interpreting it.

8. **Battery Degradation Band**
   ```tableau
   IF [battery_degradation_pct_5yr] < 10 THEN "Low (<10%)"
   ELSEIF [battery_degradation_pct_5yr] < 20 THEN "Medium (10–19.9%)"
   ELSE "High (20%+)"
   END
   ```

## 4. Dashboard layout and filters

Dashboard name: **EV Market Performance & Insights**. Use a fixed desktop canvas around 1366×900 or a range size suitable for your device; enable automatic sizing / device layouts and verify at desktop, tablet, and mobile widths.

Suggested layout:
- Header: title, subtitle, small note that data is provided benchmark data.
- Row 1: six KPI cards (records, manufacturers, sales, rating, range, capacity).
- Row 2: category performance, manufacturer leaders, customer rating treemap.
- Row 3: annual sales trend, battery technology share, manufacturing country map.
- Row 4: battery capacity vs range and price vs range scatter plots.
- Filter rail: Model Year, Category, Manufacturer, Manufacturing Country, Battery Type. Show only the four most useful filters by default if space is limited; retain Battery Type as an additional filter in the dashboard.
- Add a reset-filter instruction or revert button if supported by your Tableau version.

Set filters to **Apply to Worksheets → All Using This Data Source**. Add highlight/filter actions only where they make interpretation clearer. Keep tooltips concise and use consistent number formats.

## 5. Eight-scene Tableau Story

The SkillWallet screenshot's story example includes a multi-scene narrative and the requested metric is “No of Scenes of Story”. Build **8 scenes** with the following names:

1. **EV Market Performance at a Glance** — KPI overview and problem framing.
2. **Understanding EV Category Distribution** — category count and sales contribution.
3. **Leading Manufacturers Driving the EV Market** — top manufacturers by annual sales.
4. **Customer Engagement Across EV Categories** — ratings by category and rating bands.
5. **Growth Trend in Annual EV Sales** — model-year trend; note that model year is not necessarily the actual year of sales.
6. **Battery Technology Market Share** — battery mix, capacity and degradation.
7. **Global EV Manufacturing Footprint** — country-level distribution and region differences.
8. **Key Business Insights & Recommendations** — summary, caveats and actionable implications.

Create each scene using a relevant worksheet/dashboard, add a short caption with one evidence-based takeaway, and ensure the story navigation works. Do not claim causal relationships from descriptive comparisons.

## 6. Performance testing and evidence

The generated `outputs/performance_benchmark.json` measures local SQLite query timings only. For SkillWallet's Tableau performance fields, record actual values from your machine:

- **Amount of Data Rendered:** 199,999 cleaned training rows (39 fields including `source_split`) in the source table; the 100,000-row test split remains separate. Also note the number of marks rendered in individual charts; it will differ by view.
- **Utilization of Filters:** at least 4 visible interactive filters; recommended 5 (year, category, manufacturer, country, battery type).
- **Number of Calculated Fields:** 8 recommended calculated fields above.
- **Number of Visualizations / Graphs:** 9 unique worksheets (KPI panel + 8 chart views; if the evaluator counts only chart types, report the exact number of distinct worksheets and chart types separately).
- Measure dashboard initial load and filter response with a stopwatch, repeat 3 times, and report median. Do not invent timings.
- Test filter combinations: one filter, two filters, and all visible filters at once. Check that values update and no chart goes blank unexpectedly.
- Test responsive layouts at desktop and mobile widths.

## 7. Publish and embed

1. Save the workbook locally.
2. In Tableau Public, choose **File → Save to Tableau Public** and sign in.
3. Give the workbook a clear name, e.g. `EV Market Performance & Insights`.
4. Publish and inspect the dashboard and story in a browser.
5. Copy each view's public URL. Configure `TABLEAU_DASHBOARD_URL` and `TABLEAU_STORY_URL` in `.env`.
6. Restart Flask and test `/dashboard` and `/story`.
7. Ensure the published views are accessible without a private account. Public workbooks are publicly viewable; do not publish confidential data.
